                                                    Once your parcel has been received by our team it can take up to 5 days to fulfil your request. Returns are dealt with in the order in which they are received so returns sent by Recorded Delivery may reach us more quickly but do not progress more quickly through the process.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    When we have dealt with your parcel we will confirm this to you by email, assuming you have given us your email address.
                                                    Please remember that it can take roughly 10 days after we have processed a refund payment for it to appear on your credit card statement.

                                                    Processing time may vary depending on the Credit Card Company. Orders paid by PayPal, Alipay, WeChat Pay or by Bank Wire Transfer will be refunded to the original account.
                                                    Refunds will be issued in the same currency as the original purchase. Any differences in the amount refunded are due to exchange rate fluctuations and will not be reimbursed.
                                                    If Express Shipment was included free of charge the Refund amount will not be affected.
                                                    If Express Shipment was added and paid for during checkout by the Client, it will not be included in the Refund amount.

                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    If, after sending your return to us, you have not received our email confirmation within 10 days, please contact us on "number" (Monday - Friday 8.00am to 10.00pm, Saturday 9am to 5pm, Sunday 10am to 4pm) so we can investigate.

                                                    We are always very disappointed on the rare occasions our customers receive a faulty item. If you have identified the fault within 14 days of purchase, then you can return the item under our normal return procedure for exchange or refund. Make sure you let us know about the fault so we can make sure other items are not affected. We will refund any postage on a faulty item, and ensure you are reimbursed for standard return postage on the item.

                                                    If a fault develops outside of the 14 day return period, or the item is difficult to package and return, contact us on "number" (Monday - Friday 8.00am to 10.00pm, Saturday 9am to 5pm, Sunday 10am to 4pm) or by email on services@gomobishop.com before you return the item so we can discuss the fault with you and agree the best way forward. Please take extra care of the product and any specific care instructions provided with your purchase.
